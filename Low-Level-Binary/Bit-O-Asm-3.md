# Bit-O-Asm-3

## Description
Can you figure out what is in the eax register? Put your answer in the picoCTF flag format: picoCTF{n} where n is the contents of the eax register in the decimal number base. If the answer was 0x11 your flag would be picoCTF{17}.

## Challenge Information
**Point Value:** 100  
**Category:** Low Level Binary

## Hints
1. Not everything in this disassembly listing is optimal.

## Solution
We are given a disassembler dump:
```
<+0>:     endbr64 
<+4>:     push   rbp
<+5>:     mov    rbp,rsp
<+8>:     mov    DWORD PTR [rbp-0x14],edi
<+11>:    mov    QWORD PTR [rbp-0x20],rsi
<+15>:    mov    DWORD PTR [rbp-0xc],0x9fe1a
<+22>:    mov    DWORD PTR [rbp-0x8],0x4
<+29>:    mov    eax,DWORD PTR [rbp-0xc]
<+32>:    imul   eax,DWORD PTR [rbp-0x8]
<+36>:    add    eax,0x1f5
<+41>:    mov    DWORD PTR [rbp-0x4],eax
<+44>:    mov    eax,DWORD PTR [rbp-0x4]
<+47>:    pop    rbp
<+48>:    ret
```
The only lines we need to look at are:
```
<+15>:    mov    DWORD PTR [rbp-0xc],0x9fe1a
<+22>:    mov    DWORD PTR [rbp-0x8],0x4
<+29>:    mov    eax,DWORD PTR [rbp-0xc]
<+32>:    imul   eax,DWORD PTR [rbp-0x8]
<+36>:    add    eax,0x1f5
```
Here we store 0x9fe1a and 0x4 in two seperate pointers. Then 0x9fe1a is stored in the eax register, and we multiply that with 0x4. That value is stored in eax, and then we add 0x1f5, which overwrites eax. We are left with a large hex value, that gives us our flag once converted to decimal.

## Flag
picoCTF{2619997}
