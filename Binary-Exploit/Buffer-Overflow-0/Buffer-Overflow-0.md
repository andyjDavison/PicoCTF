# buffer overflow 0

## Description
Smash the stack Let's start off simple, can you overflow the correct buffer? The program is available here. You can view source here. And connect with it using: ```nc saturn.picoctf.net 64712```

## Challenge Information
**Point Value:** 100  
**Category:** Binary Exploitation

## Hints
1. How can you trigger the flag to print?
2. If you try to do the math by hand, maybe try and add a few more characters. Sometimes there are things you aren't expecting.
3. Run man gets and read the BUGS section. How many characters can the program really read?

## Solution
Looking at the main function in the code it seems like a simple buffer overflow problem, since it is written in C we can cause a seg fault as the maximum size of the flag is 64 bits. If we input a string of chars greater than 64 bits, as I input aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa, we get the flag.
